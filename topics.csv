Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at one atmospheric pressure. Let 0 b T be the boiling point of pure solvent and b T be the boiling point of solution.', 'This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution.', 'These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent.']"

The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry s law states that  the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas (x) in the solution  and is expressed as: p = KH x (1.11) Here KH is the Henry s law constant.', 'For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. Raoult s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p1 be 1.4.2 Raoult s Law as a special case of Henry s Law 1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids Fig.', 'The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult s law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult s law is stated as: 0 0 total 1 2 2 1     p p x p x . Solutions which obey Raoult s law over the entire range of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult s law, called positive and negative deviations are observed.']"

Molal depression constant for benzene is 4.9 K kg mol 1. What is the percentage association of acid if it forms dimer in solution? The given quantities are: w2 = 2 g; Kf = 4.9 K kg mol 1; w1 = 25 g, DTf = 1.62 K Substituting these values in equation (1.36) we get: M2 =  1  1 4.9 K kg mol   2 g   1000 g kg 25 g   1.62 K = 241.98 g mol 1 Thus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is = 241.98 g mol 1 Now consider the following equilibrium for the acid: 2 C6H5COOH   (C6H5COOH)2 If x represents the degree of association of the solute then we would have (1   x ) mol of benzoic acid left in unassociated form and correspondingly 2 x as associated moles of benzoic acid at equilibrium.', 'If w2 gram of solute of molar mass M2 is dissolved in w1 gram of solvent, then molality, m of the solution is given by the expression: m = 2 2 1 /M /1000 w w = 2 2 1 1000     M w w (1.31) Substituting the value of molality in equation (1.30) we get DTb = b 2 2 1   1000     K M w w (1.32) M2 = 2 b b 1 1000         K T w w (1.33) Thus, in order to determine M2, molar mass of the solute, known mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and DTb is determined experimentally for a known solvent whose Kb value is known. 18 g of glucose, C6H12O6, is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a saucepan.
