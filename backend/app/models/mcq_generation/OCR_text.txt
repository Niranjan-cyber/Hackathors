Pema and her brother Palden reside in Gangtok. On a cold winter 
evening, they are sitting around a ﬁ replace. Palden shares his 
experiences of visiting Kerala during the winter vacation. He 
says that compared to Gangtok, winter in Kerala is comparatively 
warm and humid. Both Pema and Palden are curious about why 
some places are so cold and others quite hot. 
Hearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a 
retired science teacher, says, “Kerala is closer to the equator than 
Sikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer 
and more humid weather conditions”. Palden replies, “Yes, we 
learnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the 
Earth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around 
the equator, the climate is generally hot”. 
As they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother 
cooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal 
pan. Pema asks, “Why are cooking utensils generally made of 
metals?” Palden immediately responds that they had studied 
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’ that such 
materials are good conductors of heat.

How does heat get 
transferred in these 
materials?
Let us perform an activity to learn why certain materials are 
good conductors of heat.

Take a strip of a metal, such as aluminium 
or iron, about 15 cm long. 
Attach four pins to the strip with the help 
of wax such that they are arranged at 
nearly equal distances (about 2 cm apart), 
as shown in Fig. 7.1. 
Secure the strip to a stand and label the 
pins as I, II, III, and IV, as shown in Fig. 7.1. 
(If a stand is not available, place the strip 
between two bricks for support.)
Heat the end of the strip that is away from 
the stand with a candle or a spirit lamp.

the strip or will they fall?
Predict the order in which the pins will fall from the strip. 
Record your observations in Table 7.1. 
 Heat Transfer in Nature
91
You observed that the pin closest to the candle ﬂ ame (pin I) 
falls ﬁ rst, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before 
pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? 
From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think 
that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the 
end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and 
approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, 
the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the 
colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of 
an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, 
the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, 
and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from 
their positions. 
Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them 
easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are 
good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for 
cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the 
process of conduction.
If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place 
of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can 
you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the 
chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’? 
Materials such as glass and wood do not 
allow heat to pass through them easily and 
are poor conductors (insulators) of heat. 
Clay and porcelain are also poor conductors 
of heat — that is why tea or coﬀ ee kept in 
such cups stays hot longer.
List some materials around you and 
classify them as good or poor conductors 
of heat in Table 7.2.

Now, I know, why we 
generally 
use 
metal 
utensils for cooking, 
whereas we prefer clay

drinking tea or coﬀ ee.

Woollen fabric traps air in its pores 
and as air is a poor conductor of heat, 
it reduces heat ﬂ ow from our bodies to 
our surroundings. As a result, we feel 
warm. Similarly, air trapped between 
the layers of clothing acts as a poor 
conductor of heat and keeps us warm. 
The presence of air between two thin 
blankets is the reason why we prefer 
them over one thick blanket to keep 
us warm (Fig. 7.2).
Is it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much 
by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with 
a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer 
to keep them cool or warm.
FASCINATING FACTS
The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi 
in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy 
snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm 
during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow 
dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors 
of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.

There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using 
hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in 
summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the 
hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.
Pema draws Palden’s attention to the 
rising smoke from the burning ﬁ rewood, 
around which they are sitting.

To understand why smoke rises, let us perform an activity. 
Why is the smoke

Now, adjust the positions of the cups, 
so that the stick is horizontal.
Place a burning candle below one of 
the cups (Fig. 7.3b). 
Observe what happens to the cup.
Record your observations in Table 7.3 
and think of probable reasons.
Table 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons
Observation about the cups
Probable reasons for the observation
You observed that the cup under which the candle 
was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air 
around the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the 
cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. 
As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. 
You can experience the expansion of air on 
heating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in 
the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets 
heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. 
You must have observed that when an incense 
stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a 
mixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released 
when something burns. As it is warmer than the surrounding air, 
it rises up.
Let us ﬁ nd out how heat transfer 
takes place in liquids by performing 
the following activity.

Caution— This activity should be carried out under the supervision of 
a teacher or an adult.

permanganate at the centre of the beaker’s base (Fig. 7.5a).

7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze
Palden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during 
winter vacation and says, “During the day, the sand or soil near 
the beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night, 
the sand or soil is cooler than the water.” Pema replies, “Yes, 
diﬀ erent objects get heated and cooled diﬀ erently.” 
Let us check how land and water get heated and cooled by 
performing an activity. 
Activity 7.4: Let us investigate
Caution— This activity should be carried out on a clear, 
sunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult.
Take two identical bowls as shown in Fig. 7.6.
Fill one bowl halfway with soil and the other bowl 
halfway with water. 
Fix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as 
shown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the 
thermometer are immersed in soil and water, and 
do not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls.
Place the set-up in sunlight.

temperature of soil and water

Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the 
water.
As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving 
up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b).
Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the 
middle and come down from the sides? The water at the 
bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. 
It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the 
sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, 
and comes down to take the place of the rising water. 
Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises.
This cycle continues until the entire volume of water 
gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets 
heated through the actual movement of water particles. 
This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It 
is because of convection that we see the movement of the 
coloured streak inside the beaker.
Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated 
up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes 
place by the actual movement of particles of liquids and 
gases from one place to another.

Did the temperature rise by the same amount for both the 
soil and the water at the same time?
If not, which one got heated faster?
How much was the rise in temperature of the soil and the 
water in 20 minutes?
After 20 minutes, you will ﬁ nd that the temperature of the 
soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil 
heats up faster than water. 
Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil 
and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 
20 minutes. You will observe that 
the soil cools faster than water, 
just as it gets heated faster.
People 
living 
in 
coastal 
areas experience an interesting 
phenomenon 
caused 
by 
the 
heating and cooling of land and 
water at diﬀ erent rates. As the 
land gets heated faster than water 
during the day, it causes warm 
air above the land to rise. This 
causes cooler air to move from 
the sea towards the land. This 
movement of cooler air from the 
sea to the land is called sea breeze 
(Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from 
the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are 
placed facing the sea.

At 
night, 
the 
process 
reverses. In the absence of 
sunlight, land cools down 
faster than the water in the 
sea. As a result, the air above 
the sea is warmer and rises 
up. Cooler air from the land 
then moves towards the 
sea, creating a land breeze 
(Fig. 7.7b).
Thus, people living near 
the seashore experience that 
the direction of the wind 
reverses in the day and night. 
7.3 Radiation 
Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around 
the ﬁ replace? They felt warm.
Their grandfather tells them that the 
heat transfer, in this case, takes place 
directly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a 
process known as radiation. The heat of the 
Sun reaches us through this process. Heat 
transfer by radiation does not require any medium. 
All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot 
utensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. 
What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating 
heat to its surroundings.
Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured 
clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during 
winters? 
Light-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on 
them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing 
them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, 
absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable 
with dark-coloured clothes during winters.

There are many examples in our daily life, where we can 
observe conduction, convection, and radiation happening 
together.
Consider the case of water being heated up, as 
shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in 
which the pan and the water get heated up, as well 
as the warmth we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot 
pan. Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil 
by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil 
gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we 
feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to 
radiation.
Let us wrap up!
From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that 
there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These 
are conduction, convection, and radiation. 
In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives 
heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so 
on. The particles themselves do not move away from their 
positions.
In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual 
movement of particles. 
Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be 
present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. 
In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to 
another and no material medium is required for its transfer.
FASCINATING FACTS
In the upper reaches of the Himalayan 
region, a traditional room heater locally 
known as bukhari is used to keep rooms 
warm during winters. It consists of an iron 
stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. 
A long pipe attached to the upper part of 
the heater serves as a chimney, venting 
out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari
can be used for cooking, as its ﬂ at top 
provides a platform for placing utensils. 
All the three processes of heat transfer 
are involved when this device is used for 
cooking and warming up the room.

You have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that 
the Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth. You have seen 
your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet 
clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun 
makes the evaporation of water faster. 
Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the 
evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from 
water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon 
of water cycle to understand this in more detail.
7.4 Water Cycle
y
You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, 
that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls 
the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms 
snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar 
regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the 
Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and 
ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows 
down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is 
replenished by fresh snow during winters. 
Water in the oceans, 
rivers, and lakes gets 
heated due to the Sun, and 
as a result, it evaporates 
as water vapour. Water 
also 
evaporates 
from 
trees and plants through 
transpiration. 
When water vapour 
rises up, it cools down 
and condenses to form 
clouds. 
Clouds 
bring 
rain, snow, and hail. 
This process is called 
precipitation. 
The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour 
and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, 
and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water 
cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and 
replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to 
conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that 
falls on the surface of the Earth, ﬂ ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, 
and oceans or seeps into the ground.

Do your ﬁ ndings match with your predictions?
You may have observed that water seeps fastest through 
gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why 
is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when 
compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep 
through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps 
beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water 
seeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water 
can inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and 
rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11).
The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces 
of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface 
as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and 
rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers 
(Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or 
drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few 
metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending 
on the location.
Fig. 7.12: Aquifer
Rain
Inﬁ ltration

However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water 
requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive 
groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover 
and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited 
water inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. 
To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used 
to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that 
groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a 
sustainable groundwater supply.

Since water scarcity makes life diﬃ  cult, people have 
developed diﬀ erent ways to conserve water. For example, in 
Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve 
water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Ice Stupa
During the spring season in 
Ladakh, streams often dry 
up, leading to scarcity of 
water as the heat from the 
Sun’s radiation is not enough 
to melt the snow on the 
mountains. During winters, 
water 
from 
mountain 
streams is channeled down 
through underground pipes. 
This water is then sprayed 
into the cold air. As it falls, it 
freezes due to extremely low 
temperatures. 
The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped 
structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa 
melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other 
needs throughout the summer.
Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa
In a Nutshell
There are three ways in which heat is transferred from one 
place to another — conduction, convection, and radiation.
The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object 
to a colder part is called conduction. In this process, particles 
do not move from their positions.
Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are 
called good conductors of heat.
Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily 
are called poor conductors (insulators) of heat.
In solids, heat is mainly transferred through the process of 
conduction. In liquids and gases, heat is transferred by the 
process of convection.
